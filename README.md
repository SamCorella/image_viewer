# Image Viewer
An image gallery application written in Python.

## How to Run:
Ensure Tkinter and PIL modules are installed:

`python image_viewer.py`

## What Can Image Viewer Do?
* Open a File Dialogue to upload images from any directory.
* Display images of varying sizes.
* Show the index of the currently displayed image.
* Maintain the total number of images uploaded.
* Scale down high resolution images automatically to fit within the application window.
* Move forward and backward through the uploaded images.

## Project Motivation
I wanted to gain experience with creating a simple GUI based application. I chose to use the Tkinter module in this project because it makes it relatively simple and quick to set up a graphical interface that works on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux without needing to make modifications to the code. Also, Tkinter is built-in to Python, making it easy for others to run this project with minimal setup.
